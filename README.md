# Food Frenzy is a food ordering platform developed entirely in C. This application allows users to browse through a menu, place orders, and manage their food orders within the application.

# Features
- Menu Browsing: View available food items.
- Order Placement: Add items to the cart and place orders.
- Order Management: View and manage current orders.

This project is entirely coded in C, and it is my Minor Project - 1. Since the project is in C, it does not offer internet access. Thank you!
